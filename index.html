                Islamabad (/ɪsˈlɑːməˌbɑːd/; Urdu: اسلام آباد‎, romanized: Islāmābād) is the capital city of Pakistan, and is federally administered as part of the Islamabad Capital Territory. Islamabad is the ninth largest city in Pakistan, while the larger Islamabad–Rawalpindi metropolitan area is the country's fourth largest with a population of about 3.1 million.[7] Built as a planned city in the 1960s to replace Karachi as Pakistan's capital, Islamabad is noted for its high standards of living,[9] safety,[10] and abundant greenery.[11]
                The city's master plan, designed by Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis, divides the city into eight zones, including administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational sectors, industrial sectors, commercial areas, and rural and green areas which are administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation, supported by the Capital Development Authority. The city is known for the presence of several parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills National Park and the Shakarparian.[12] The city is home to several landmarks, with the most notable one being the Faisal Mosque − the largest mosque in South Asia[13] and the fifth largest in the world. Other landmarks include the Pakistan National Monument and Democracy Square.[14][15][16]
                Islamabad is a Gamma + city as rated by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.
                The city has the highest cost of living in Pakistan, and its population is dominated by middle and upper middle class citizens.[9][18]
                The city is home to twenty universities, including Bahria University, Quaid-e-Azam University, PIEAS, COMSATS University and NUST.
                The city is one of the safest in Pakistan, and has an expansive RFID-enabled surveillance system with almost 2000 CCTV cameras.[10][20]
